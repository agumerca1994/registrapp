"""A small in-process rate limiter for the public OAuth endpoints.

`/oauth/register` is unauthenticated by definition (that's what dynamic client
registration means), so it needs a brake or anyone can fill the table. Same for
`/oauth/token` and the consent endpoint.

In-process is enough here: the container runs a single uvicorn worker. If that
ever changes, each worker gets its own counters and the effective limit becomes
N times what's configured — worth moving to Postgres at that point.
